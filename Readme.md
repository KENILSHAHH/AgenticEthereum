# Verifiable AI Agents Using EigenLayer AVS

## Overview

AgentAVS demonstrates a novel approach to deploying verifiable AI agents on decentralized platforms by leveraging Eigenlayer Active Validated Services (AVS). These AI agents not only execute intelligent tasks but also produce verifiable proofs of their operations, ensuring that every decision or action is transparent, secure, and auditable. Integrating Eigenlayer AVS means that each computation is continuously validated using on-chain mechanisms, enhancing trust and accountability in critical applications.

## Verifiable AI Agents ? 
Verifiable AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perform tasks and make decisions while generating cryptographic proofs for their actions. These proofs enable any interested party to audit the agent‚Äôs behavior, ensuring:

Transparency: Every computation is logged and can be independently verified.

Security: Tamper-resistant mechanisms ensure that malicious alterations are easily detected.

Accountability: Detailed, immutable records support regulatory compliance and dispute resolution.

## Why EigenLayer AVS for AI Agents?

### ‚úÖ **Verifiable Execution**
- AI agents running on EigenLayer AVSs inherit **trust and security** from Ethereum‚Äôs decentralized infrastructure.

### üí∞ **Cost Efficiency**
- EigenLayer AVSs reduce **onchain computation costs**, making frequent AI-driven transactions practical.

### üèó **Modular & Scalable**
- Developers can create **modular** agents that interact seamlessly with **smart contracts, APIs, and LLMs**.

### How it works ? 

1) User creates a request and send it to the agent

2) Agent computes on the request and returns with a response

3) EigenLayer operators verifies the response received through core contracts and signs on the resposne
