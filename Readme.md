# Verifiable AI Agents Using EigenLayer AVS

## Overview

AgentAVS demonstrates a novel approach to deploying verifiable AI agents on decentralized platforms by leveraging Eigenlayer Active Validated Services (AVS). These AI agents not only execute intelligent tasks but also produce verifiable proofs of their operations, ensuring that every decision or action is transparent, secure, and auditable. Integrating Eigenlayer AVS means that each computation is continuously validated using on-chain mechanisms, enhancing trust and accountability in critical applications.

## Verifiable AI Agents ? 
Verifiable AI agents are autonomous systems designed to perform tasks and make decisions while generating cryptographic proofs for their actions. These proofs enable any interested party to audit the agent’s behavior, ensuring:

Transparency: Every computation is logged and can be independently verified.

Security: Tamper-resistant mechanisms ensure that malicious alterations are easily detected.

Accountability: Detailed, immutable records support regulatory compliance and dispute resolution.
